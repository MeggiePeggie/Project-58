    <p>My favourite hobby is dancing. For me, it's also a skill and/or talent. Dancers are one of the fittest people in the world, so it's also good for your health. You can never get bored of dancing. Dancing also increases your flexability. When you start dancing really well, you can go into conserts and compitions. That will increase your confidence in not only dancing, but in other things to! Just from doing that hobby, you have developt a life skill/talent.

 Stretching to prepare to dance may hurt, but it pays off when you see yourself doing amazing things.</p>
